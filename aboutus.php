As a result of Strong’s approach, each and every patient has an extensive number of specialists who can be seamlessly integrated into their health care team. A condition is never isolated. Patients always have a team of people and specialists taking care of them, all supported with the highest technology. That technology also applies to communication. All of a patient’s medical information is consolidated into a single medical record thus eliminating potential for miscommunication.

This means that if you go in for a standard procedure and there is a complication, a specialist is on hand to be instantly included into your health care team. Moreover, that specialist represents the most advanced medical care and research. When you combine this expertise with Strong’s philosophy of developing a meaningful partnership with patients and families the result is nothing short of a transformational patient experience.</h2>
